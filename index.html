      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, 
      Berkeley, double majoring in Applied Math and Computer Science. I am
      especially interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

      My Experience

    <h4>
      NewsBreak
    </h4>
    <p>
      I interned at NewsBreak, a company that focuses on providing news tailored to a userâ€™s 
      location and interests through their mobile app, NewsBreak, under my mentor, Zhengwen Wang. 
      I worked as a front-end programmer for the NewsBreak iOS app, where I used XCode to design a 
      part of the app and became proficient in Swift, data fetching, and programmatic coding in UIKit. 
      The part I designed will be released as the discover-search page of the app.

    <h4>
      UCSD Nanomaterials and Nanomedicine Laboratory
    </h4>
    <p>
      I interned at UCSD as a Research Analyst Intern. I implemented
      modern cell membrane coating technology, including cell counting, pating,
      culturing, and membrane derivation procedures. I made use of lab equipment
      such as autoclaves and pipettes. Our results were published in an
      academic journal: "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/btm2.10187">Cartilage-targeting ultrasmall lipid-polymer hybrid
      nanoparticles for the prevention of cartilage degradation</a>," <i>
        Bioengineering & Translational Medicine, 2021; 6; e10187.

      <h4>
        Matrix Multiplication
      </h4>
      <p>
        I implemented matrix multiplication in a mix of C and Python, then optimized it
        with unrolling, cache blocking, parallelizing, call reducing, and other optimizations. 
        The finished result created matrix objects from certain input and performed 
        matrix multiplication on the matrices.

      <h4>
        Project Ark
      </h4>
    </a>
      <p>
        A video game made using characters from the game "Arknights"
        and gameplay inspired by "Smash Bros." I started this game as just
        a tool to practice my Java skills, so that I wouldn't ever get rusty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game has three characters (the fourth currently does not work)
        and is best played with two players. It is admittedly not 
        user-friendly, as it was only intended as a for-fun project and 
        I frequently have to stop part way through some update due to 
        school. The game is run from the driver file in src.

          Pintos Multithreaded Operating System
        </h4>
      </a>
      <p>
        I wrote an operating system in Pintos using C. The system has the basics, such as process execuation, 
        syscalls, and floating point operations. It is multithreaded, implementing
        locks, thread priorities, priority lending, and an internal clock.
