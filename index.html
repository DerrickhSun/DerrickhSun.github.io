      <h4>
        Matrix Multiplication
      </h4>
      <p>
        I implemented matrix multiplication in C, then optimized it
        with cache blocking, parallelizing, and call reducing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, as this is a school project, I cannot make it
        public. If you want to view it, contact me.

      <h4>

    </a>
      <p>
        A little video game made using characters from the game "Arknights"
        and gameplay inspired by "Smash Bros." I started this game as just
        a tool to practice my Java skills, so that I wouldn't ever get rusty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game has three characters (the fourth currently does not work)
        and is best played with two players.
